Question #2 Container With Most Water (Medium)

You are given an array of positive integers where each integer represents the height of a vertical line on a chart. Find two lines which together with the x-axis forms a container that would hold the greatest amount of water. Return the area of water it would hold.

Rules:
-Thickness does not affect area
-Right and left sides do not count as walls
-A higher line inside the container does not affect the area
-Area = length x width

How to solve:
-Look for specific max value


```
const getMaxWaterContainer = function(heights) { //array is heights
    let maxArea = 0; //initialize
    
    for (let P1 = 0; P1 < heights.length; P1++>) { //define P1 and P2
        for (let P2 = P1 + 1; P2 < heights.lenght; P2++) { //similar to first problem

           //set up constants
            const height = Math.min(heights[p1], heights[p2]);
            const width = P2 - P1; 
            const area = height * width;
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);
        }
    }
    return maxArea;
};
```
