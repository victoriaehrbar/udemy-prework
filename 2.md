Question #2 Container With Most Water (Medium)

You are given an array of positive integers where each integer represents the height of a vertical line on a chart. Find two lines which together with the x-axis forms a container that would hold the greatest amount of water. Return the area of water it would hold.

Rules:
-Thickness does not affect area
-Right and left sides do not count as walls
-A higher line inside the container does not affect the area
-Area = length x width

How to solve:
-Look for specific max value (max width between 2 pointers)
-Area is determined by shorter height, or else it would overflow
-2-pointer approach to keep track of string indices (one at beginning and one at end)


```
const maxArea = function(height) {
  let maxArea = 0;
  //define P1 and P2 to not get error
  let P1 = 0;
  let P2 = height.length - 1; //array position
  
  while (P2 > P1) {
      let lineHeight = Math.min(height[P1], height[P2]);
      let width = P2 - P1;
      let area = lineHeight * width;
      maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);
      
      if (height[P1] <= height [P2]) {
          P1++;
      } else {
          P2--;
      }
  }
  
  return maxArea;
};
```
